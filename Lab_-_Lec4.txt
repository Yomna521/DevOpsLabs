	ls -i /etc

	cp /etc/passwd "$HOME/mypasswd"
	cmp /etc/passwd mypasswd
	diff /etc/passwd mypasswd

	cmp /etc/passwd mypasswd  ---> /etc/passwd mypasswd differ: byte 573, line 14

5. Create a symbolic link of /etc/passwd in /boot.
	ln -s /etc/passwd /boot
6. Create a hard link of /etc/passwd in /boot. Could you? Why?
	It is not possible to create a hard link across different filesystems; you can create only symbolic links.
